# CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PROJECT

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to this open source project! Itâ€™s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.


### FILES NAMING CONVENTION

- Files naming should follow the ``snake_case`` convention
- Eg: database_integration.cpp
- file name with ``camel_cases`` will not be accepted, eg: CamelCase.cpp or Camel_Case.cpp

### ISSUES

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.


### PULL REQUESTS

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo **docs** directory. For each pull feature you added, please provide a documentation in a readme file. The readme file naming should match the pull request's number. (eg: PR_2.md)
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.
